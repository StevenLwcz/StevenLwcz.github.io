### About Me

A few years ago I bought a Raspberry Pi and that has re-ignited my desire for programming as a hobby rather than a profession.

I wanted to learn about Arm Assembler and I've heard good things about Python. I think it reminded me of BASIC from my days of ZX81 and Amstrad 6128.

To debug assembler on a Raspberry PI, there is GDB. And at looking more into GDB I discovered there was a Python API.

Well they added the Python API so you could enhance your debug experiance, so that is exactly what I have been doing. My primary focus has been on assembler. I've read a lot of great stuff on the Python API but noticed a few gaps. Maybe I can fill some of them.

I would not be on this journey without having read some excellent blog posts. So I hope to sneak in links to them as the occasion occurs.
